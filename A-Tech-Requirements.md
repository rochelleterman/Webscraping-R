# Software Requirements

To participate in thisworkshop, you will need access to the software described below. 

## R

[R](http://www.r-project.org/) is a programming language that is especially powerful for data exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis. To interact with R, we use [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/).

To download R, go to [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) (the **C**omprehensive **R** **A**rchive **N**etwork). Ensure that you download the latest release of **R Version 4.0**.

If you use a Mac, this will require at least 10.11 (El Capitan) as your OS. If you use a PC, anything Windows 7 or later will be sufficient.

## R Studio

To interact with R, we use RStudio. Please install the latest desktop version of [RStudio IDE](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/download/desktop). We will not support RStudio cloud.

## R Packages

You’ll also need to install some R packages. An R package is a collection of functions, data, and documentation that extends the capabilities of base R. Using packages is key to the successful use of R. 

Many of the packages that you will learn in this class are part of the so-called `tidyverse`. The packages in the `tidyverse` share a common philosophy of data and R programming, and are designed to work together naturally.

**To install packages, open RStudio. Go to Tools > Install Packages.** Enter the following: `tidyverse, knitr, rtweet`

If you have problems installing packages, make sure that you are connected to the internet, and that https://cloud.r-project.org/ isn’t blocked by your firewall or proxy. If RStudio returns an error message, go to "Preferences" and check the "Packages" section. Under "CRAN Mirror," if no mirror is selected, choose "Global (CDN) - RStudio". 

## Modern Web Browser

You will need to have a modern web browser installed to perform some of the tasks in this class. The recommended browser for this class is [Google Chrome](https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en_uk/chrome/).

## Selector Gadget

As part of the webscraping process, you will need to examine HTML elements in your data. In this class we will be using [Selector Gadget](https://selectorgadget.com/) for this purpose.

If using Google Chrome, you can simply install the [Selector Gadget Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectorgadget/mhjhnkcfbdhnjickkkdbjoemdmbfginb?hl=en). If for any reason you can't use Chrome extensions (including on Chrome itself), you can instead install selector gadget by following the instructions on the [Selector Gadget website](https://selectorgadget.com/).

## Troubleshooting

Software Carpentry maintains a list of common issues that occur during installation may be useful for our class here: [Configuration Problems and Solutions wiki page.](https://github.com/swcarpentry/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions)
