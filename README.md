# Data Access: Webscraping with R

**Data Science Summer School**

July 20, 2021

4:00 - 8:15pm CEST

https://socialdatascience.network/courses/webscraping.html

**Instructor**: [Rochelle Terman](http://rochelleterman.com/), rterman@uchicago.edu

**TA**: Pete Cuppernull


### Overview

This short course teaches students how to extract, store, and process data from the Internet using the R statistical programming language. Students will learn how to collect internet data in a variety of forms, including application programming interfaces (APIs) and scraping the open web. We will assume students have basic knowledge of R and RStudio. Participants with no prior experience with R are encouraged to complete [this brief tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r) to learn the basics of R before the course.

### Objectives 

This course is geared towards social scientists who work with are interested in extracting, processing, and analyzing data from the internet. By the end of the course, participants will:

1.  Understand basic legal and ethical issues surrounding web scraping.
2.  Collect data via RESTful APIs:
    * Master key principles and concepts of RESTful APIs.
    * Use plug-n-play R packages for popular APIs such as Twitter, Google Translate, and others.
    * Write a custom API query to extract data from RESTful APIs, such as the New York Times Article API.
3.  Collect data via web scraping:
    * Understand how HTML & CSS work to display a website.
    * Inspect a website using Google Developer Tools and SelectorGadget to understand its underlying structure and identify elements.
    * Write a program that scrapes multiple webpages using R.

### Prerequisites

Students must have basic computer skills, must be familiar with their computerâ€™s file system, and must be comfortable entering commands in a command line environment. 

The workshop will also assume basic knowledge of the R programming language. Participants with no prior experience with R are strongly encourged to complete [this brief tutorial](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-r) to learn basics of R before the course.

### Software Requirements

Due to the nature of webscraping, we will not be executing code together. Instead, students will watch my screen for coding demonstrations. Thus, you are not required to download or install any software on your computer besides Zoom.

However, we expect that students will want to work through the coding demonstrations on their own after class. See the [tech requirements page](A-Tech-Requirements.md) for detailed information on the software we'll be using. 

If you want to work through the API demonstration, you'll need to register your own API key by following [these instructions.](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started)

### Materials

All course materials will be available on GitHub, including slides, code demonstrations, etc. 

Download the materials on your computer by running the following code in RStudio. Note that for this to work, you will need to have installed `tidyverse` installed.

```
# install tidyverse if you haven't already done so.
install.packages("tidyverse")

library("usethis")
use_course("rochelleterman/webscraping-R")
```
