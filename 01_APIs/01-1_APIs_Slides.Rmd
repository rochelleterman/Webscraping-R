### Collecting Data from the Web

There's a ton of web data that's useful to social scientists, including:

* social media
* news media
* government publications
* organizational records

--

There are two ways to get data off the web:

1. **Web APIs** - i.e. application-facing, for computers
2. **Webscraping** - i.e. user-facing websites for humans

__Rule of Thumb__: Check for API first. If not available, scrape.

### What is an API?


* API stands for **Application Programming Interface**

* a set of rules and procedures that facilitate interactions between computers and their applications

---
### Web APIs

* allows users to query a remote database over the internet

* take on a variety of formats 

* majority adhere to a particular style known as **Representational State Transfer** or **REST**

* "RESTful" APIs are convenient because we can use them to query databases using URLs 


---
### RESTful Web APIs are All Around You...

Consider a simple Google search.

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/google_link.png")
```

Ever wonder what all that extra stuff in the address bar was all about?  

---
### RESTful Web APIs are All Around You...

It looks like Google makes its query by taking the search terms, separating each of them with a "`+`", and appending them to the link:

`https://www.google.com/#q=`

So that we have

`https://www.google.com/#q=search1+search2`

So can change our Google search by adding some terms to the URL.

---
### Some Basic Terminology: URL

* Uniform Resource Location

* a string of characters that, when interpreted via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

* points to a data resource, notably files written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or a subset of a database.

---
### Some Basic Terminology: HTTP Methods / Verbs

* *GET*: requests a representation of a data resource corresponding to a particular URL.  The process of executing the GET method is often referred to as a "GET request" and is the main method used for querying RESTful databases.
    
*  *HEAD*, *POST*, *PUT*, *DELETE*: other common methods, though mostly never used for database querying.

---
### How Do GET Requests Work?  A Web Browsing Analogy

* Surfing the Web = Making a bunch of GET Requests

* For instance, I open my web browser and type in http://www.wikipedia.org.  Once I hit return, I'd see a webpage.

* Several different processes occurred, however, between me hitting "return" and the page finally being rendered. 

---
### Step 1: The GET Request

* web browser took the entered character string 

* used the command-line tool "Curl" to write a properly formatted HTTP GET request 

* submitted it to the server that hosts the Wikipedia homepage.

---
### STEP 2: The Response

* Wikipedia's server receives this request

* send back an HTTP response

* from which Curl extracted the HTML code for the page

```{html}
"<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"mul\" dir=\"ltr\">\n<head>\n<!-- Sysops: 
Please do not edit the main template directly; update /temp and synchronise. 
-->\n<meta charset=\"utf-8\">\n<title>Wikipedia</title>\n<!--[if lt IE 7]><meta
http-equiv=\"imagetoolbar\" content=\"no\"><![endif]-->\n<meta name=\"viewport\"
content=\"i"
```

---
### STEP 3: The Formatting

* raw HTML code was formatted and executed by the web browser

* rendering the page as seen in the window.

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/wikipedia.png")
```

---
### RESTful Database Querying: The GET Request

* URL we supply must be constructed so that the resulting request can be interpreted and successfully acted upon by the server.  

* Likely that the character string must encode **search terms and/or filtering parameters**, as well as one or more **authentication codes**.  

* While the terms are often similar across APIs, most are API-specific.

---
### RESTful Database Querying: The Response

* unlike web browsing, the content of the server's response that is extracted by Curl is unlikely to be HTML code. 

* will likely be **raw text** response that can be parsed into one of a few file formats commonly used for data storage.  

* usual suspects include .csv, .xml, and .json files.

---
### RESTful Database Querying: The Formatting

* web browser parsed the HTML code, 

* but **we need R, Python, or other programming languages** to parse the server response 

* and convert it into a format for local storage (e.g. matrices, dataframes, databases, lists, etc.).

### Finding APIs

Here are some APIs that may be useful to you:

- [NYT Article API](http://developer.nytimes.com/):  metadata (title, summaries, dates, etc) from all NYT articles in their archive.

- [GeoNames geographical database](https://www.geonames.org/):  lots of geographical information for all countries and other locations. The `geonames` package provides a wrapper for R.

- [The Manifesto Project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/.):  text and other information on political party manifestos from around the world. The `manifestoR` package provides a wrapper for R.

- [The Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/developers/): datasets from US Census Bureau. The `tidycensus` package allows users to interface with the US Census Bureau’s decennial Census and five-year American Community APIs.

---
## Getting API Access

* For most APIs, a key or other user credentials are required
* Most APIs are set up for developers, so you’ll likely be asked to register an "application"
* rate limits = total number of calls / time
* NYT API = 10 calls per second and 10,000 calls per day

```{r echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "img/nytimes_key.png")
```

---
### Using APIs in R

There are two ways to collect data through APIs in R.

1. **Plug-n-play packages**

- Common APIs are available through user-written R Packages. 
- functions that "wrap" API queries and format the response. 
- usually much more convenient than writing our own query, so it's worth searching around for a package that works with the API we need.

2. **Writing our own API request**

- If no wrapper function is available, we have to write our own API request, and format the response ourselves using R. 
- This is trickier, but definitely do-able.
